##Introduction

This is my thesis project - **Detecting Spammers on Twitter**. The goal of this project is to detect spammers in Twitter by using link analysis method and machine learning methods.

##Updates

* Doing Feature Selection and Visualization on this dataset.

* ~~I have converted all the source code into Java version due to the speed of Python is too slow.~~
